> ✨ A beautiful, modular GUI interface for discovering and managing packages across the Arch Linux ecosystem and beyond.

---

## 🎯 What is GhostView?

**GhostView** is the GUI companion to [`ghostbrew`](https://github.com/ghostkellz/ghostbrew), designed for users who want a clean, visual interface to browse and manage:

- 📦 **Pacman** packages (GUI & system)
- 🎯 **AUR** and **Chaotic-AUR**
- 📦 **Flatpak** packages from Flathub & other remotes
- 🧩 **KDE/GNOME** apps, categorized by desktop environment
- 🔧 Curated **GitHub Repositories** for key Linux tools
- 🐧 Future: **Debian packages**, Snap support, and more!

Whether you're building a lean Arch install, searching for a Flatpak alternative, or exploring curated GitHub tools — **GhostView** is your spectral window into the Linux software world.

## 💡 Key Features (Planned)

| Feature | Status |
|--------|--------|
| 🔍 Unified package search (Pacman/AUR/Flatpak) | 🚧 WIP |
| 🌈 Beautiful Tauri-based UI | ✅ Scaffolded |
| 🧙‍♂️ GhostBrew-powered backend | ✅ |
| 📚 Curated GitHub repo browsing | 🧪 Experimental |
| 🛰️ Connect to custom AUR repo (hosted by you) | 🔜 |
| 🔐 Secure install previews + reviews | 🔜 |
| 📡 Remote backend / daemon mode for ghostbrew | 🧠 Planning |
| 🛠️ App-specific actions (launch, uninstall, update) | 🔜 |

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- 🦀 **Rust** + [**Tauri**](https://tauri.app)
- 🧩 **Ghostbrew** (Go backend, CLI or daemon)
- 🖼️ Planned frontend: Svelte / SolidJS or Tauri-native templates

---

## 📦 Goals

GhostView aims to:
- Be the **best lightweight GUI for Arch-based software discovery**
- Stay **modular** — plug in any backend (Pacman, Flatpak, GitHub)
- Respect the user's environment — no packagekit or snapd bloat
- Eventually serve as a front-end to a **custom AUR mirror** or **GhostBrew repository**

---

## 🔮 Future Vision

- 🏗️ Build `ghostbrew-repo` hosting infrastructure
- 📦 Serve `.pkg.tar.zst` directly with NGINX or GhostGate
- 🛠️ GUI-based build helper & PKGBUILD explorer
- 🧠 Local LLM-powered software recommendations
- 🌐 Optional web-based version (Electron/Tauri/Web)
